#  ●  Use Cases

## 1. Incident Response (Live Triage)

During active incident response, analysts often need rapid visibility into process integrity without dumping full memory images.

K-Scanner enables:

- Quick detection of suspicious RWX mappings
- Identification of potentially injected processes
- Fast anomaly triage before deeper forensic acquisition

It is especially useful when downtime must be minimized.

---

## 2. Production Environment Monitoring

In hardened Linux servers (e.g., web servers, API gateways, backend services), executable-writable memory is typically unnecessary.

K-Scanner can be used to:

- Validate W^X compliance
- Detect unsafe runtime behavior
- Audit memory permissions during security reviews

---

## 3. Security Research & Exploit Development Labs

In controlled lab environments, K-Scanner can help:

- Observe memory permission behavior during exploitation
- Validate payload injection techniques
- Study JIT allocation patterns
- Understand runtime permission transitions

It provides practical visibility into memory-level attack surfaces.

---

## 4. Red Team Validation

During post-exploitation simulations, K-Scanner can be used defensively to:

- Evaluate detection visibility of injection techniques
- Measure exposure of RWX-based payloads
- Test stealth techniques against permission-based monitoring

---

## 5. Hardening Verification

After applying security hardening policies, K-Scanner can help confirm:

- No unexpected RWX regions exist
- Runtime services comply with memory protection best practices
- Deployment configurations do not introduce unsafe flags

---

## 6. Academic and Educational Use

K-Scanner can serve as:

- A teaching tool for understanding Linux memory mapping
- A demonstration of W^X principles
- A practical example of non-intrusive forensic tooling in C

---

## 7. Limitations in Real-World Use

K-Scanner should not be used as:

- A full malware detection platform
- A substitute for EDR solutions
- A kernel integrity verifier

It provides targeted visibility, not comprehensive threat coverage.
